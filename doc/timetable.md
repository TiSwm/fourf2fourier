# 45 - 60 Minutes timeboxed

## 10 minutes theory
## 10 minutes playing with the setup that is not adjusted but kind of works (wrong position of both lenses)

## Adjust the setup 15 minutes
* ideas for getting a better image?
    * change illuminator
    * change position of mask
    * change position of camera
    * change lenses
    * change aperture setting
    * change lens positions
* Assume that we have object, illumination and camera fixed --> change lens positions
    * which mask to use?
    * which lens first --> calculate the sensitivities --> that is the reason for the manipulator
    * is the distance between the two lenses relevant?
* eyballing it is good enough for us here

## Look at different structures and change aperture 15 minutes
* theory: what is the resolution limit of the setup?
    * How can we improve?
    * what is a potential problem during assembly (flip first lens)
    * benefits of the telecentric imaging
* experiment:
    * what is the size of the smallest structure you can find?
    * how can we quantify image quality?
    * where are the particles that we can see?
    * why does the fourier pattern not change when moving the mask?
    * what can we do with the rotatable slit?
* both groups should exchange ideas at the end

## -5 to 20 minutes of extra time
* can we do something with the illumination? --> Monopole what are the disadvantages?
* how would you go about making the adjustment a stable process that doesn't rely on optics knowledge?
* how do does the problem change when considering mirrors?
* the theory group shoudl
